## Introduction

Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), poses serious health and environmental challenges worldwide. Kathmandu Valley suffers from high PM2.5 levels due to its geography, rapid urbanization, and dense population, worsening respiratory illnesses and environmental quality (Shakya et al., 2017). Accurate modeling and forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations are essential for effective mitigation.

## Project Overview

This project compares various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in Kathmandu Valley. Models are developed and evaluated to identify the best-performing approach.

## Data and Methods

- Data sources: Air quality measurements, meteorological data, and geographic information.  
- Tools and frameworks: Python (libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch), ArcGIS Pro for spatial data processing.  
- Model comparison based on accuracy, RMSE, and other relevant metrics.
